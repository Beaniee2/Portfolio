### The challenge
Users should be able to:
Naviagte their way through the different pages with ease and submit a contact form that is submitted through to an email. 

### Built with
-CSS
-HTML

### What I learned
I found this project challenging to being with, once I understood the structure and the order in which the instructions needed to be it became a lot easier. With more knowledge I would like to come back to this and play around with some of the styling.

### Continued development
I would like to learn more CSS styling and how to optimize it.
