### The challenge
Users should be able to:
Naviagte their way through the different pages with ease and submit a contact form that is submitted through to an email. They should be able to navigate easily through the different pages. In the footer of the page, users can click on the email, linkdin and github icons and be re-directed to the appropriate page in a new tab. The 'My projects' page is for users to be able to see the projects that I have created, these links will open into a new tab. 

### Built with
-CSS
-HTML

### What I learned
I have learnt a lot about the way coding needs to be written and how the order of the can effect the desired outcome. 

### Continued development
I would like to learn more CSS styling and how to optimize it. I really struggled with how to make the site viewable and user friendly on different screen sizes, especially mobile viewing.
