### What I learned
I have learnt a lot about the way coding needs to be written and how the order of the can effect the desired outcome. I dont think it is as perfect as I would like, but as I continue to learn and develop I will change the coding and style on this. 

### Continued development
I would like to learn more CSS styling and how to optimize it. I struggled with how to make the site viewable and user friendly on different screen sizes, especially mobile viewing. After doing more research into this I understood it more and managed to make it a lot more mobile friendly.
